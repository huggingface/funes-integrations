# The converter's acceptance test: a real Claude Code transcript, trimmed and secret-scanned, and
# the turns file it must produce. `expected.funes.jsonl` is what funes's own Claude parser emitted
# while it had one, so a change here that moves a chunk id re-keys sessions users already hold. It
# differs from that output in two ways that move no id: the tool output says `tool` where the parser
# said `user`, and the last two turns are messages typed while Claude was working, which the parser
# dropped.
